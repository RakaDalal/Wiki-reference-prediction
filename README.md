I crawled wikipedia for academic CS articles starting from Wikipedia Books to gather information (date of entry, number of edits) about the references that
have been added to the wikipedia articles till 2012. The data was cleaned, analyzed and subsequently more information about the academic references
(abstract, publication venue) was gathered from another dataset containing information about all CS publications till 2014. Next, I extracted interesting
statistics such as N-gram frequency, tf-idf values to predict references that will be added in the future and obtained high precision and recall.
